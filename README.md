# Building-a-Neural-network

Learn to Build a Neural Network from Scratch.

## Hello world,
In this repo, we will learn about Neural networks and also how to build Neural Networks by playing with some toy codes.

In simple words, Neural networks are "computer system modelled on the human brain and nervous system".
neural networks comprizes of Artificial neurons. 

## But, what the hack is an Artificial neuron?
Well, there is no rocket science,
Consider this image below to understand.
![Relation b/w Biological and Artificial neuron](neuron.png)

In that Artificial neuron, you can see an encircled equation in the middle, that equation is nothing but an Activation function, if you want to learn about them [here](https://github.com/Optimist-Prime/A-Story-of-Activation-Functions) is the link.

Assuming that you totally understood above image, we may proceed further.

### Now lets build our first neural network in python.
only dependency here is numpy
for example lets consider a table below
